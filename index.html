    <p><img src="assets/images/blake.JPG" style="width:150px; height:200px;"></id>My name is Blake Bovaird. I was born and raised in Columbus,Ga, where I resided for 26 years 
        before moving to Tennesse and then to my current home in Orlando, Fl. 
        My hobbies range from anything outdoors such as kayaking or hiking to hosting dinner parties 
        and trying new restaurants with friends. I absolutely love to travel and hope to end up in a 
        career in which I can sometimes work remotely from anywhere in the world. I've always thought
        that learning coding would be extremely fulfilling and was exactly what I was looking for.</p>
